# NPS Calculator 🚀

Want to know how happy your customers are? This simple tool calculates your Net Promoter Score (NPS) in a flash!

**What's NPS?**

Think of it as a customer happiness barometer.  We ask: "How likely are you to recommend us?"  People score from 0 to 10:

* **9-10:** Promoters (your biggest fans!) 🎉
* **7-8:** Passives (meh, they're okay) 😐
* **0-6:** Detractors (uh oh, not happy) 💔

We then crunch the numbers to give you your NPS.

**Quick Start**

2.  **Run it!** `python nps_calculator.py` (or whatever command applies)
3.  **Enter the numbers:** Promoters, Passives, and Detractors.
4.  **See your NPS!** ✨
